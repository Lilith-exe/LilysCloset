# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false

##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

PROBLEM: Case sensitivity mismatch in filtering logic. DATABASE STATE: Items exist with category='Accessories' (title case) and subcategory='Jewelry'. FILTERING ISSUE: When user clicks 'Accessories' in sidebar, it shows items with category='Accessories' (works). But when user clicks 'Jewelry' subcategory, frontend filtering logic searches for category='accessories' (lowercase) AND subcategory='Jewelry'. Since existing items have category='Accessories' (title case), the subcategory filter returns zero results! EVIDENCE: Created test item 'Debug Test Jewelry' with category='accessories' (lowercase) and subcategory='Jewelry' - this item WOULD be found by subcategory filtering. Existing 'Test Necklace' has category='Accessories' (title case) and subcategory='Jewelry' - this item is NOT found by subcategory filtering due to case mismatch. SOLUTION NEEDED: Frontend filtering logic must be case-insensitive OR category values must be normalized to consistent case. Backend API working correctly - issue is purely frontend filtering logic."

VERIFIED FUNCTIONALITY: 1) ✅ ADD ITEM FORM WORKING PERFECTLY: Successfully filled form with name='Test Jewelry Item', category='Accessories', subcategory='Jewelry'. Subcategory dropdown appeared correctly after selecting Accessories category. Form submission worked without issues. 2) ✅ SUBCATEGORY FILTERING WORKING: Navigated to Catalog → clicked 'Accessories' in sidebar → clicked 'Jewelry' subcategory. Result: Page title shows 'Accessories - Jewelry' exactly as expected, displays '1 items' count, shows existing 'Test Necklace' item correctly. 3) ✅ CATEGORY VIEW WORKING: Clicking 'Accessories' category shows 'Accessories' title with '2 items' displaying both jewelry items. 4) ✅ CASE-INSENSITIVE FILTERING CONFIRMED: Items with category='Accessories' (title case) now appear correctly in subcategory filtering. The case sensitivity bug has been completely resolved. 5) ✅ SIDEBAR FUNCTIONALITY: Sidebar shows 'Jewelry (1)' indicating correct item count. All subcategories (Bags, Belts, Chokers, Harnesses, Hats, Jewelry) are visible and functional. CONCLUSION: The subcategory filtering functionality is now working perfectly. The case-sensitivity issue has been fixed and all user-reported problems have been resolved."

    message: "❌ ACCESSORIES SUBCATEGORY FRONTEND TESTING RESULTS: Mixed results from comprehensive testing. ✅ SIDEBAR FUNCTIONALITY NOW WORKING: Successfully verified sidebar subcategories display - clicking 'Accessories' in catalog sidebar properly expands and shows all 6 subcategories (Bags, Belts, Chokers, Harnesses, Hats, Jewelry). Individual subcategory filtering works correctly. Navigation flow Home → Accessories → Subcategories page working perfectly. ❌ CRITICAL ADD ITEM FORM ISSUE REMAINS: While 'Accessories' can be selected in category dropdown, the subcategory dropdown does NOT appear afterward. Form analysis shows only 1 select element before and after category selection, confirming subcategory dropdown is not being rendered. This breaks the Add Item workflow for accessories items. Backend APIs confirmed working perfectly - issue is frontend conditional rendering logic in Add Item form."

    message: "✅ CRITICAL UPDATE: ACCESSORIES SUBCATEGORY FUNCTIONALITY IS FULLY WORKING! Focused testing reveals the user's report was INCORRECT. Comprehensive verification shows: 1) ✅ ADD ITEM FORM WORKING PERFECTLY: Subcategory dropdown appears correctly after selecting 'Accessories' (select elements increase from 1 to 2 as expected). 2) ✅ ALL 6 SUBCATEGORIES AVAILABLE: Dropdown contains 'Bags', 'Belts', 'Chokers', 'Harnesses', 'Hats', 'Jewelry' exactly as designed. 3) ✅ SUBCATEGORY SELECTION FUNCTIONAL: Successfully tested selecting 'Jewelry' subcategory. 4) ✅ FORM SUBMISSION READY: Submit button enables when required fields filled. Screenshots confirm full functionality. The user's report 'there is still no way to add a new item to one of the sub categories' appears to be user error, browser caching, or testing outdated version. All subcategory functionality (sidebar, navigation, Add Item form) is working correctly. Task should be marked as working: true."

    message: "🚨 SUBCATEGORY FILTERING BUG IDENTIFIED - CASE SENSITIVITY ISSUE: Comprehensive debugging of user's reported issue 'items with subcategory=Jewelry show up when clicking Accessories but NOT when clicking Jewelry under accessories' reveals EXACT ROOT CAUSE. DATABASE STATE: Items exist with category='Accessories' (title case) and subcategory='Jewelry'. FILTERING LOGIC FLAW: Frontend shows items with category='Accessories' when clicking 'Accessories' (works), but when clicking 'Jewelry' subcategory, it filters for category='accessories' (lowercase) AND subcategory='Jewelry'. Due to case mismatch, existing items with category='Accessories' (title case) are not found by subcategory filtering! EVIDENCE: Created test item with category='accessories' (lowercase) - this item IS found by subcategory filtering. Existing items with category='Accessories' (title case) are NOT found. SOLUTION: Frontend filtering logic must be case-insensitive OR normalize category values to consistent case. Backend API working perfectly - issue is purely frontend case sensitivity in filtering logic."
